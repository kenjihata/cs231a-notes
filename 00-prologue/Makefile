# MAIN LATEXMK RULE

CC = latexmk 

# -pdf tells latexmk to generate PDF directly (instead of DVI).
# -pdflatex="" tells latexmk to call a specific backend with specific options.
# -use-make tells latexmk to call make for generating missing files.

# -interaction=nonstopmode keeps the pdflatex backend from stopping at a
# missing file reference and interactively asking you for an alternative.
CFLAGS = -pdf -pdflatex="pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode" -use-make
